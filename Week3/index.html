Hey there, I'm Daren, a 22-year-old IT student from Asia Pacific College, Makati City. My journey to this point has been quite the ride. Initially, I had my sights set on studying Architecture at Mapua University, but with the onset of COVID-19, I decided it wasn't the right time to be on campus. So, I shifted gears and enrolled at AMA University Makati as a BSIT student. After two years there, I felt it was time to come back to APC to finish what I started.

I've always been passionate about programming and gaming. That's why I'm really looking forward to diving deep into web development in this course. I expect to learn a lot â€” HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side programming, databases, Git, and all the emerging web technologies.

But it's not just about web programming. I want to be well-rounded in my field. That means mastering programming languages, understanding software development methodologies, getting a grip on database management, networking concepts, cybersecurity, and even project management.

Outside of academics, you'll often find me glued to my computer screen, either gaming or working on a coding project. I also love hitting the basketball court whenever I get the chance.

Ultimately, my goal is to become a wealthy traveler, exploring various destinations around the world. It's a dream I'm determined to turn into reality.
