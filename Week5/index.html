<h5>DAREN JOHN B. BARCIA</h5>
<p>
Hey there, I'm <i>Daren</i>, a <em>22</em>-year-old <ins>IT student</ins> from <strong><mark>Asia Pacific College, Makati City.</mark></strong> My journey to this point has been quite the ride. Initially, I had my sights set on studying Architecture at <mark><del>Mapua University</del></mark>, but with the onset of <small>COVID-19</small>, I decided it wasn't the right time to be on campus. So, I shifted gears and enrolled at <mark><del>AMA University Makati</del></mark> as a BSIT student. After two years there, I felt it was time to come back to APC to finish what I started.

I've always been passionate about programming and gaming. That's why I'm really looking forward to diving deep into web development in this course. I expect to learn a lot â€” <sub>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side programming, databases, Git, and all </sub> the emerging web technologies.

But it's not just about web programming. I want to be well-rounded in my field. That means mastering programming languages, understanding software development methodologies, getting a grip on database management, networking concepts, cybersecurity, and even project management.

Outside of academics, you'll often find me glued to my computer screen, either gaming or working on a coding project. I also love hitting the basketball court whenever I get the chance.

Ultimately, my goal is to become a <sup>wealthy traveler</sup>, exploring various destinations around the world. It's a dream I'm determined to turn into reality.
